# Code Challenge 2
Your program contains a singly linked list object that contains n elements. You want to find out the element at the 25% of n index. For example, the list contains 20 elements, so n = 20. 25% of n would be 5, so your program needs to return the element at the 5th index.

Keep in mind that your program should always round down when considering the index position. For example, 4.75 would become 4th index.

Similar to the previous question, your linked list can obtain values via the user or randomly.

The value for n should be >= 10 at a minimum.

Your code should only ever use a single loop (i.e. no nested loops).
