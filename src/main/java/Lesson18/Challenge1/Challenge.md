# Code Challenge 1
Write the code that defines two separate linked lists, each containing x and y elements (x and y are not necessarily the same, and are less than 5). Then write a method that will combine both of those linked lists.

Your code must adhere to the following guidelines:

* The values for the lists can be randomly generated or provided by the user.

* Your code must not introduce a third LinkedList object.

* Your code must only use a single loop at any time (i.e. no nested loops).
